title = 'LLM Transformers as ETL Transformers'

In a world full of AI hype—from chatbots that write code to flashy demo applications—I always felt that most tools were geared toward niche use cases like building QA bots or RAG agents. What really got me excited, however, was discovering a game-changing application for production-scale, non-AI companies: using LLMs to revolutionize ETL processes.

Traditionally, both the data source and the target had to be strictly structured. Data engineers spent countless hours writing code to map input data into a very specific schema. With LLMs the input data can be completely unstructured, and the model takes on the heavy lifting of transforming it into structured, usable data.

The impact of this shift is huge. Imagine being able to quickly convert videos and texts into structural data, then using that data to build analytical dashboards. Suddenly, you have real-time information at our fingertips, empowering decision-makers to act on solid, real data. As the saying goes, data is power.

Moreover, Data engineers no longer need to wrestle with error-prone code for every conversion. Instead, they can rely on LLMs to handle the transformation reliably, freeing them up to focus on other important challenges within production-scale environments.

This new approach not only speeds up the process of building robust analytical tools—it also reduces manual errors, ultimately driving better and faster decisions across the organization.
