    Title: About Me
    Content: >
      I'm a software engineer with over five years of experience building and scaling resilient systemsâ€”mostly in e-commerce and cloud platforms. My passion lies in designing robust architectures, improving development workflows, and helping teams work more efficiently through automation and thoughtful engineering.


      I love taking ownership of complex challenges, collaborating across teams, and finding ways to make both products and processes better. Whether it's optimizing performance, leading technical initiatives, or mentoring teammates, I thrive on making a meaningful impact.
